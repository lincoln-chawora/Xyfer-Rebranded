Okay so today was the day, good day bad day? good i think, interesting to grow and discovered!

#Okay, how it begun
- talk, offer, accepted (skeptically), went, met, walked, talked, took pics, talked, drove
- new offer, i accept, nothing at first and then suddenly i was in- in the ZONE,
- a different experience
    - songs more enjoyable
    - trying to enjoy the moment 
    - trying not to be in my head 
    
#Thoughts and (feelings)
experienced things in a different way in terms of time 
1. in the moment, but out of body and experiencing the thing as it happens, like a passenger to my own life
2. became a bit more removed, started seeing the moment after it happened - kept going for ages 
3. loads and loads of talking 
4. realised that thoughts were visualised but not within the mind but outward 
5. was thinking thoughts and saying them all
6. felt the need to be truthful
7. felt happy and confident
8. wanted to remember the feeling and the experince of it all

#During
Things when [redacted] (real time account)

1. Titanic vs desert
    1. Ocean is reverse desert // it flips (do sketch)
2. It’s circle (you experience the moment) it spins a bit more, you come out and experience the moment from before
3. I’m recognising time based on past events the have come (you’re sounding like bullshit and you know it)

New question for later
[redacted - info in the original]

Got home and now I’m Hella hype listening to Yelawolf whilst eating sensations
